# Exam guidelines

## Option 1: competition

The main goal of a competition exam project is for you to demonstrate your skills in solving a
real-world machine learning problem. You can consult the existing solutions, shared kernels, etc.
but blind re-use of such materials is prohibited. If you are basing (a part of) your solution on
someone else’s work, be sure to make a proper reference to that work, and also to have a sizeable
personal contribution on top of that.

Your work will be evaluated against the following criteria:

1. Skills demonstrated. Generally, by solving this task you want to show your skills in **data preprocessing**,
**feature engineering** and **feature selection**, **model development**, **model selection** and
**model quality assessment**. You should be able to justify your choices.
1. Presentation quality. Make sure that your audience understands:
    1. the problem you were trying to solve,
    1. what exactly you did, and
    1. what results you obtained

Getting high ranks on the leaderboard is not required, but it surely will be taken into account when
grading if you do get it.


## Option 2: paper

Here you’re taking an advanced machine learning paper and implementing the method described in it
and/or reproducing (trying to validate) the experiments from that paper, if any. Your work will be
evaluated against the following criteria:

1. Understanding of the paper. You want to demonstrate your skills in analysing and understanding
new material related to research in machine learning. Make sure that you can deliver the main ideas
of the paper to a person not familiar with it.
1. Completeness and quality of the practical work done. It would not be ok to just run the code that
was shared by the authors of the original paper. You need to implement the technique on your own. If
they did share the code - try to make a comparison of your implementation vs theirs.
1. Presentation quality. Make sure that your audience understands:
    1. the problem you were trying to solve,
    1. what exactly you did, and 
    1. what results you obtained
